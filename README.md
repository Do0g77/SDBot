# SDBot
SDbot for SQL integration and access to Call Handling Docs


This is my first coding attempts.

This bot should have a limited response, bascially asking for a ticket reference, name, closing or updating the call. 

There are also help files in there for keywords. Outlook setup, printer setup and links etc. 

looking at making the ticket updates to email into our system and close/update the call.
